This project is one of my favorite machine learning builds because I created the entire dataset myself.
Instead of downloading a real estate dataset, I generated realistic house features such as:
	• area (in m²)
	• number of rooms
	• age of the house
	• distance from city center
	• neighborhood score
	• price in USD

This project shows that I understand data creation, preprocessing, regression modeling, evaluation, and how ML connects to real-world problems like real-estate pricing

Why I Did This Project

I wanted to create a complete ML pipeline, not just train a model.
So I challenged myself to build:

- a custom dataset
- a regression model
- full evaluation (RMSE, R²)
- example predictions
- clean and reproducible code

It is also part of my ML learning path as I prepare for university studies in data science.
